first attempt at creating a repository
Hi, my name is Alex.  I've been a librarian for a dozen years or so, and I'm ready to try something different.  I've always had a facility with numbers (ever heard of the Dewey Decimal System?), and there's not really good data science training locally that fits my schedule.  Three months ago I finished a programming degree at Greenville Technical College, a few miles from my home in the country that's also a short drive from the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Many of my courses were online, so I have an idea of what's necessary to do well in the certificate program.
